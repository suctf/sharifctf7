See `"playfake.py"`, and decrypt the following ciphertext:

`Ciphertext = KPDPDGYJXNUSOIGOJDUSUQGFSHJUGIEAXJZUQVDKSCMQKXIR`

Notice that flag is generated using `"msg"`, not `"msg2"`.
After decryption, you get `"msg2"`.
You must manually add spaces and perform other required changes to get `"msg"`.
Call `make_flag(msg)` to get the flag.

PS: `make_flag()` is defined at the end of "`playfake.py`".
